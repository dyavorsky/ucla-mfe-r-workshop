There are a tremendous set of resources for learning R.  But two excellent, free books are:

1. **[R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)** by Hadley Wickham & Garrett Grolemund, which introduces R and the Tidyverse
2. **[Advanced R](https://adv-r.had.co.nz/)** by Hadley Wickham, which dives into all the gory details

I would also strongly recommend 

 - **[ggplot2: Elegand Graphics for Data Analysis](https://ggplot2-book.org/)** by Hadley Wickham, Danielle navarro, and Thomas Lin Pedersen 
 - The **[data.table](https://rdatatable.gitlab.io/data.table/)** website and vignettes
 - The **[Quarto](https://quarto.org/)** website and documentation

For a HUGE collection of free online resources, consult the **[Big Book of R](https://www.bigbookofr.com/)** compiled by Oscar Baruffa.
