      <description>Please do the following before our first workshop session on Monday Sept 23 at 10:00am&#xA;1. Get R Download (or update to) the latest version of R (version 4.4.1) from https://cran.r-project.org/&#xA;R is a software environment for computing, data analysis, and graphics. It’s like Python, but geared toward statistical work; like Stata, but better for programming; like Julia but people actually use it; like Matlab, but free.&#xA;You are welcome to open the minimal R app once downloaded. It’s extremely basic: a single-paned window with a “&gt;” prompt. You type R commands at that prompt (e.g., 2+2 and hit enter). Using R this way works just fine, but it’s rather unfriendly.</description>

      <description>Submit Attendance: link&#xA;Files for today: example | vectors | matrices | lists | data.frames&#xA;Object Types Variables Variables are named objects; objects result from the evaluation of an expresssion Names can be assigned with an equals sign (=) or the assignment operator (&lt;-, alt+minus shortcut) For example, with x &lt;- 2+2, the expression 2+2 evaluates to a length-one vector holding value 4, to which we have bound the name x Many ways to check the “type” of data in an R object My preferred method is to assess the structure of an object using str() Additional options include mode() / typeof() / class() among others You can check data types or convert between data types For example, using is.character() to check or as.character() to convert Special “values” in R include: TRUE and FALSE logical values (coerced to 0 and 1 when used in mathematical operations) NA indicates a placeholder for a missing value Inf and NaN result from, eg, dividing by zero NULL indicates a placeholder for a missing vector object It is helpful to think that everything in R is either an object or a function (and functions themselves are objects) The expression 2+2 is actually a call to the +() function, as in `+`(2,2) Vectors R automatically performs vector recycling when operating on multiple vectors of different lengths This makes a lot of sense when one of the vectors has length-one It can lead to nice “tricks” in very special circumstances However, in general for vectors longer than length-one, it is unusual behavior Vector can be subset using square brackets [] by: Position number, or a vector of position numbers – no zero-based indexing like Python or C++ Logical vectors, often of the same length as the vector to be subset Element names, if the elements of the vector are named Logical tests are extremely common Use double-equals == to test for equality Use != to indicate not-equal-to R heavily utilizes vectorized functions For example, if x=c(4,9,16) then sqrt(x) returns (2,3,4) Matrices Matrices are vectors with a dimension attribute Matrix math, ie Linear Algebra, is common in statistical applications Standard operators (+, -, *, /) are element-wise Matrix multiplcation uses the %*% operator Transpose via t() Invert via solve() or a Choleski decomposition Subset a matrix with square brackets [] Uses form [row index, column index] Blank index indicates “all” You can “sweep” a function over the rows or columns Simple functions are built-in, such as RowSums() and ColMeans() Alternatively, use apply() Lists Lists are generalized vectors Each element of a vector holds a value, each element of a list “holds” an R object You can nest lists; ie a list element could be another list Most algorithmic functions in R return lists, eg, lm(), kmeans(), prcomp() List subsetting / extracting elements Single brackets [] return a list object Double brackets [[]] or dollar sign $ extract a list element It is common to apply a function to each object in a list lapply() returns a list of results, sapply() returns a (simplified) vector Data.frames Data.frames are an extremely useful object for analysis You can think of them as an Excel table However, they are list objects in R with certain constraints and special properties Each element of the list (ie column of a data.frame) is a vector of the same length These vectors (ie data.frame columns) can store values of different types To subset a data.frame, use the list and vector subsetting operations already discussed To add a new column, syntax is the same as adding a new list element Sorting is simply subsetting the dataframe with all rows (in a different order) returned Common analytic operations Use aggregate() to perform a common split-apply-combine summary analysis Use merge() to combine multiple data.frames based on the values of select key columns Categorical variables are called “factors” in R Offer efficient storage when the number of levels (values of the categorical variable) is much fewer than the number of rows of the data.frame Many algorithms handle them appropriately, eg, gender in the linear regression lm(height ~ weight + gender) Data Input/Output R is generally fantastic at getting data in and out of R, but we’ll focus only on 2 common approaches: read.csv() brings data in, stored as a data.frame object write.csv() does exactly what you think save() write one or more objects to disk in an efficient R-specific storage format load() reads in saved objects</description>

      <description>Submit Attendance: link&#xA;Files for today: data.table | tidyverse | functions&#xA;Data.table Data Table Overview Created by Matt Dowle, now maintained by others Check out its homepage here and be sure to read the vignettes! Mature, stable project that provides enhancements to the Base R data.frame object Provides concise syntax that is efficient to read and write Is fast, with many operations internally parrellelized Has no dependencies other than Base R. Syntax dt[i,j,by] matches SQL commands: where, select, group by i subsets rows, no need to refer to dt$ or extra comma when requesting all columns in the subset, eg dt[i] not df[df$i,] j selects columns using list() or .(), or creates columns using := aggregation occurs when a vector of grouping variable(s) is specified in by altogether this makes split-apply-combine a single, concise command .SD and .SDcols are used to operate on multiple columns Data Table also provides: a set of set_ convenience functions, my favorite is set_names() fast data input/out with fread() and fwrite() fast rolling joins Tidyverse Tidyverse overview Created by Hadley Wickham, now assisted by Posit team A collection of R packages that share common principles and are designed to work together seamlessly Enhanced the Base R data.frame with the tibble Two stand-out packages are dplyr for common operations with data.frames and ggplot2 for plotting Tidyverse functions encourage pipe |&gt; operations, which make code supremely readable and beginner-programmer-friendly Pipe is cmd + shift + m on Mac and ctrl + shift + m on Windows dplyr verbs for working with data.frames/tibbles: the 5 verbs and group_by filter() selects rows arrange() orders by row select() chooses columns mutate() creates new columns summarize() with group_by() split-apply-combine aggregations You’ll stumble accross other gems such as distinct(), count(), sample_n(), transmute(), slice(), n(), etc. Offers the best syntax for reshaping data from wide to long (or vice-versa) with pivot_wider() and pivot_longer() Functions and Control Flow Use the function() function to create your own function Functions have: Formals, which are the list of arguments that control how you call the function A body, which returns the last evaluated expression or whater you put in return() An environment, which determines scoping (ie, how the function finds the values associated with named objects) There are some R-specific things to be aware of Lazy evaluation Things that appear to have the same name, eg fun(x=x) Anonymous “lambda” functions Control Flow if() {...} else {...}, and ifelse() with assignment loops via foreach() and while()</description>

      <description>Submit Attendance: link&#xA;Files for today: base plots | ggplot2 | quarto&#xA;Base Plots R has excellent plotting capabilities, but often requires lots of code to fully customize the plot Base plots are static No resizing or zooming Adding elements to a plot is done by layering on top, not modifying what exists You’ll often want to change: The color col, point character pch, fill color fill, line width lwd, or size via character expansion cex The title main, horizonal axis label xlab, and vertical axis label ylab Margins via par(mar=c(...)) Any many other features, several highlighted in these [article1, article2] Add elements to your plot with: lines(), curve(), text(), or points() or customize the axis() and add a legend() To combine multiple plots: Use par(mfrow=c(x,y)) Control outer margins with par(oma=c(...)) Place a title via title() layout() offer richer arrangements of subplots ggplot2 An introduction: The ggplot2 package is Hadley Wickmham’s implementation of a Grammar of Graphics described in Leland Wilkinson 2005 book It is immensely popular, with re-implementations in Python and Julia It is powerful and expressive method of creating graphics, and well documented with a website, book, and many other resources Every ggplot involves A dataset usually via ggplot(data) Aesthetic mappings from variables in the dataset to plot elements, eg, aes(x=height, y=weight) One or more geometric objects (eg, points in a scatterplot via geom_point()) You’ll often want to annotate basic elements with labs() such as x, y, title, and subtitle More advanced aspects of the plotting system involve A statistical transformation of the data A scale to control the mapping from data to aesthetic attributes A coordinate system Facets, for creating small multiples of plots The theme system provides fine control over the non-data elements of the plot Quarto Quarto is an open-source scientified and technical publishing system created by the team at Posit A Quarto document Can by a Jupyter Notebook or a plain text .qmd file with a YAML header Consisting of Pandoc markdown and code chunks Renders to multiple output formats including PDF, MS Word, HTML Enables reproducible research and literate programming Will likely be the mode via which you compose your homework assignments Pandoc markdown syntax: Is quite simple and the basics can be learned in an hour Includes Latex math equations, citations, cross references, and more Code chunks: Begin and end with three back ticks ` Support a variety of languages, including R, Python, Julia, C++, BASH</description>

      <description>There are a tremendous set of resources for learning R. But two excellent, free books are:&#xA;R for Data Science by Hadley Wickham &amp; Garrett Grolemund, which introduces R and the Tidyverse Advanced R by Hadley Wickham, which dives into all the gory details I would also strongly recommend&#xA;ggplot2: Elegand Graphics for Data Analysis by Hadley Wickham, Danielle navarro, and Thomas Lin Pedersen The data.table website and vignettes The Quarto website and documentation For a HUGE collection of free online resources, consult the Big Book of R compiled by Oscar Baruffa.</description>
