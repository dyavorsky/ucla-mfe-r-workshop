    <description>There are a tremendous set of resources for learning R. But two excellent, free books are:&#xA;R for Data Science by Hadley Wickham &amp; Garrett Grolemund, which introduces R and the Tidyverse Advanced R by Hadley Wickham, which dives into all the gory details I would also strongly recommend&#xA;ggplot2: Elegand Graphics for Data Analysis by Hadley Wickham, Danielle navarro, and Thomas Lin Pedersen The data.table website and vignettes The Quarto website and documentation For a HUGE collection of free online resources, consult the Big Book of R compiled by Oscar Baruffa.</description>
