    <description>Please do the following before our first workshop session on Monday Sept 23 at 10:00am&#xA;1. Get R Download (or update to) the latest version of R (version 4.4.1) from https://cran.r-project.org/&#xA;R is a software environment for computing, data analysis, and graphics. It’s like Python, but geared toward statistical work; like Stata, but better for programming; like Julia but people actually use it; like Matlab, but free.&#xA;You are welcome to open the minimal R app once downloaded. It’s extremely basic: a single-paned window with a “&gt;” prompt. You type R commands at that prompt (e.g., 2+2 and hit enter). Using R this way works just fine, but it’s rather unfriendly.</description>
